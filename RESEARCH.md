# 📘 Supplemental Resource Guide

**Computational Text from A to Z, Daniel Shiffman – Fall 2025** •
*Compiled by the Equitable Syllabus Project*

This guide expands the original syllabus for “Computational Text from A to Z” to include a broader range of voices, technologies, and frameworks. It is intended for faculty, students, and researchers interested in integrating critical, poetic, and inclusive approaches to language and code. Each section emphasizes ethical practices, experimentation, and emergent intersections between computation and textual creativity.

## 🧠 Diverse Voices in Computational Text

### 🌀 Computational Poetics

* **Allison Parrish** – “Everyword,” “Compasses” – Twitter bots and generative poetry using procedural logic. [https://www.decontextualize.com](https://www.decontextualize.com)
* **Jhave Johnston** – *ReRites* – A multi-volume poetry collection co-authored with neural nets. [https://glia.ca/rerites/](https://glia.ca/rerites/)
* **K. Allado-McDowell** – *Pharmako-AI* – A speculative dialogue with GPT-3 exploring ecology, identity, and consciousness. [https://www.kalladomcdowell.com/pharmakoai](https://www.kalladomcdowell.com/pharmakoai)

### 🌍 Decolonial / Intersectional Tech Perspectives

* **Mimi Ọnụọha** – *A People’s Guide to AI*, “The Library of Missing Datasets” – Investigations into absence, data bias, and AI literacy. [https://mimionuoha.com](https://mimionuoha.com)
* **Lauren Lee McCarthy** – Interactive performances and tools interrogating gender, surveillance, and social systems. [https://lauren-mccarthy.com](https://lauren-mccarthy.com)
* **The Fembot Collective** – Intersectional media and automation critiques. Publishes *Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology*. [http://fembotcollective.org](http://fembotcollective.org)

### 🖼️ Artist Projects and Experimental Work

* **Sarah Rothberg** – Interactive poetic experiences exploring perception, embodiment, and semiotics. Merges code, language, and play. [https://sarahrothberg.com](https://sarahrothberg.com)
* **Rafael Lozano-Hemmer** – Interactive installations combining biometric data and text. *33 Questions per Minute* and *Voice Tunnel* explore language limits and participation. [https://www.lozano-hemmer.com](https://www.lozano-hemmer.com)
* **Martine Syms** – Video, performance, and web projects investigating race, narrative structure, and digital presence. Uses text as both medium and critique. [https://www.martinesyms.com](https://www.martinesyms.com)

## 🔐 Data Privacy, Surveillance & Text Ethics

### 📚 Readings

* **Kate Crawford** – *Atlas of AI* – Chapters on linguistic labor, data extraction, and AI’s political ecology.
* **Catherine D’Ignazio & Lauren Klein** – *Data Feminism*

  * Recommended: Ch. 5 *“Power in Numbers”*, Ch. 7 *“Show Your Work”*. [https://datafeminism.io](https://datafeminism.io)
* **The Data Nutrition Project** – Toolkits for evaluating datasets for ethical use and transparency. [https://datanutrition.org](https://datanutrition.org)

### 🧰 Projects and Frameworks

* **Exposing.AI** – Searchable tool uncovering the use of public photos in facial recognition training datasets.
  [https://exposing.ai](https://exposing.ai)
* **Civic Signals** – Strategies for designing online spaces that foster healthy communication and collective flourishing.

## 🤖 ML + New Technologies for Text

### 🔧 Tools

* **RunwayML** – GUI for generative ML tools including GPT, image synthesis, and TTS. [https://runwayml.com/](https://runwayml.com/)
* **ml5.js** – Friendly JavaScript library for artists using machine learning in creative projects. [https://ml5js.org](https://ml5js.org)
* **HuggingFace Transformers** – APIs and pretrained models for generation, classification, and summarization. [https://huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)

### 💡 Key Concepts

* **Text *regeneration* vs. generation** – Rewriting, reprompting, or refining textual outputs for critical reflection.
* **Zero-shot classification** – Classify or moderate text with minimal training data using generalized ML models.
* **TTS and voice cloning ethics** – Considerations for synthetic voice systems in poetic, narrative, or activist uses.

## 🌸 Creative Prompts and Project Ideas

* **Remix the Public Domain**
  Re-author a classic novel using Markov chains, GPT-2, or n-gram remixing.
* **Hashtag Archive**
  Visualize the temporal spread and semantic evolution of an activist hashtag (with consent-aware sourcing).
* **AI Confessional**
  Build a system that “confesses” with poetic, surreal, or emotionally uncanny voice.
* **Bias Detector**
  Build a visualization or dashboard that surfaces gender/race bias in popular or historic corpora.
* **Chatbots as Poets**
  Design a poetic chatbot with GPT or rule-based logic that responds only in metaphor, haiku, or glitched syntax.
