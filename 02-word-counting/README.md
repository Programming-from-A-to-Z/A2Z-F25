## Reading

> Part of the challenge of understanding algorithmic oppression is to understand that mathematical formulations to drive automated decisions are made by human beings. While we often think of terms such as “big data” and “algorithms” as being benign, neutral, or objective, they are anything but.

- 📕 [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/detail.action?docID=4834260), Chapter 1: A Society Searching, by Safiya Umoja Noble

## Assignment

1: In preparation for next week, add a link to a data source or API (even just data that appears in raw form on a web page) that interests you! Don't worry about this too much, anything will do! I'll use this list to prepare examples for next week.

2: Choose a text or data source and count word frequencies following the examples above. Design your own creative output. This need not be visual (sonify word counts?) nor does it require code (knit your own word frequency scarf!). Some things to consider:

- Use a language other than English!
- What happens if you compare different texts according to word frequency?
- Can you look at frequency of how words appear next to each other?

Reflect on your process of word counting and consider the following questions (drawing connections to Safiya Umoja Noble’s Algorithms of Oppression, Chapter 1):

- Did you discover anything new about the text by counting words?
- What is lost from word counting?
- Challenge the assumption that algorithms for analyzing text (such as word counting or search engine rankings, as Noble shows) are neutral.
